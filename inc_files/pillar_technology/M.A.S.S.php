            <h2>Introducing Silent M.A.S.S Technology: More Air, Slow Speed</h2>
            <div class="points">
                <h4>Futuristic Design:</h4>
                <p>
                    At Haneri, we believe that true innovation lies in challenging common misconceptions and delivering solutions that redefine industry standards. Our Silent M.A.S.S Technology (More Air, Slow Speed) embodies this philosophy, and debunks the myth that you don’t need high speed (RPM) to achieve superior air delivery. Leveraging our advanced Air Curve Design and TurboSilent BLDC Motor Technology, Silent M.A.S.S delivers unparalleled performance, offering powerful airflow with near-silent operation at lower rotational speeds.
                </p>

                <h4>What is Silent M.A.S.S Technology?</h4>
                <p>
                    Silent M.A.S.S Technology is a revolutionary integration of Haneri’s two engineering marvels—Air Curve Design and TurboSilent BLDC Motor Technology. By combining aerodynamically optimized blades with high-torque, energy-efficient motors, this Trademark Registered Pillar Technology achieves exceptional air delivery at reduced RPM, redefining ceiling fan performance while ensuring whisper-quiet operation.

                <h2>The Science Behind Silent M.A.S.S Technology</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Aerodynamic Optimization with Air Curve Design:</strong>
                        Advanced blade profiles create an efficient pressure differential, maximizing air displacement while operating at slower speeds. The design minimizes resistance and turbulence, reducing energy wastage and noise.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>High-Torque Motor Performance:</strong>
                        TurboSilent BLDC Motors leverage high torque generation to power blades effectively at low RPM, ensuring consistent airflow without overloading the system. Field-oriented control (FOC) and advanced motor algorithms enable precise speed regulation, maintaining performance consistency.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Integrated System Design:</strong>
                        The synergy between Air Curve Design and TurboSilent BLDC Motors ensures that every component is optimized for efficiency and performance, eliminating bottlenecks in airflow or energy transfer.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Energy Optimization:</strong>
                        Combined with energy-efficient motor controls and low-drag blade designs, Silent M.A.S.S Technology reduces power consumption significantly, contributing to lower operational costs and a smaller carbon footprint.
